# TravellingSalesmanProblem
During my first year at Télécom SudParis I had to solve the Travelling
Salesman Problem using several heuristics. I finally choose to implement
5 heuristics to solve the problem :

- Nearest neighbor
- Nearest addition
- Nearest insertion
- Farthest insertion
- 2-opt


I also wanted to create an user interface using GTK3+
I have created all the code, assets, documentation. I also implemented
unit tests to check my implementation of linked lists.


Note : the code can be greatly improve. I coded this in 2013. Also there
are some minor UI bugs. Finally my implementation of the save functionnality
is not good at all. I could have save only the point and not a big matrice
of distance....

If you cannot compile my program, I made a video in the folder to see it in action.
